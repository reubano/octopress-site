Last month I made good on my promise to visit Carlos in the Dominican Republic. Although I wasn't able to turn my spring break into an island hopping tour around the Caribbean, I still had more fun traveling around the DR than I could have ever imagined.<br /><br />"So what happend to your plans on taking a month off to travel", I hear you ask. Well, the whole <a href="http://www.airtimetable.com/airpass.htm">caribbean air pass</a> I read about is apparently a lot harder to find than I thought. Many of the airlines discontinued their pass (e.g., <a href="http://www.liatairline.com/">LIAT</a> and <a href="http://www.caribbean-airlines.com">Caribbean Airlines</a>) and the ones that had them available didn't fly to the DR (like <a href="http://www.fly-winair.com/">Windward Islands Airways</a>). But that didn't stop me from taking a month off of work though :) (well 3 weeks, but who's counting). I spent the first week and a half catching up on work for my startup, <a href="http://www.pensero.com">Pensero Group</a>, and the next 11 days in the beautiful Dominican Republic sun. (when I get around to it, i'll put up some pics and videos... don't hold your breath though)<br /><br />And the one must do for any would be DR tourist is to visit <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=bahia+de+las+aguilas+">Bahia de las Aguilas</a>. We camped out overnight on this deserted beach which was home to the bluest water i've ever seen.</div>
